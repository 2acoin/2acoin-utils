# TurtleCoin Node.js Utilities

***Use of this code in its current state may lead to unexpected results***

This repository contains highly experimental code at this time with the goal of making it possible to interact with a daemon including wallet functionaity (sending/receiving transactions) without the need for `turtle-service` using Node.js.

The majority of the code has been ported thus far from https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin-webwallet-js which is based on the Masari Webwallet implemented by gnock.
